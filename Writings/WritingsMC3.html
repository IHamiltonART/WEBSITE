            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Excerpt from chapter 2</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial">I stood beside the same great
            curving wall of earth that I'd stumbled upon all those years
            ago, wondering what I was doing there. 'Too old,' I said to a
            cow grazing on the other side of the fence, 'for this sort of
            thing.'</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            The cow mooed a tired reply and went back to eating grass.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            Strange things cows; all that weight and strength from eating
            grass! I recalled one of my father's silly jokes. I must have
            been about six. We were driving in the country and my father
            said 'See those lumps of grass over there'. I looked out the
            window but couldn't see any lumps of grass, couldn't work out
            what my father was on about. 'The cows' he said, 'lumps of grass
            shitting grass'. Then he laughed and asked me what came first,
            the cow or the grass? My father was like that.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            It was evening and the birds had begun their noisy settling in
            for the night. Cool air drifted down the escarpment. The last
            long shadows of trees fell across the earth and over the mound
            of the ring, accentuating its height. Like a circus ring it was.
            It was extraordinary that, despite all the greedy land grabbing
            since Europeans first entered the valley, despite the effects
            of weather and the hoofs of cattle, the ring remained. Not only
            that but I could see the gap in the wall and the path that led
            from it towards the small ring.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            The whole thing had been carefully positioned at the northern
            end of a curving ridge. To the east, just beyond the ring, the
            land sloped steeply down to a creek. To the west, beyond the
            thick forest that ran along the road, I could see the tops of
            the high ranges that enclosed the valley. To the south the pathway,
            clearly visible, led between tall trees. Twenty paces beyond
            the ring's northern arc stood a tall gum tree. It seemed ancient.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            In that half light, with fence posts and wires faded into a fecund
            background of bush, it was possible to imagined a world before
            the coming of Europeans, to imagine men coming to prepare this
            sacred site. And to imagine a young boy of thirteen or fourteen
            - about the same age I was when began the journey through my
            own pubescent initiations - coming to this place of initiation,
            having travelled across a land untracked by paved road and unlit
            by streetlamps, coming full of fear and expectation to this great
            circle carved out of the body of the earth. Would he not have
            come full of fear and excitement to begin the trials of manhood?
            Which would have been much tougher than the trials I encountered.
            There'd be no shoes to protect his feet, or tins of camp pie
            to ease his hunger, or pillows to lie on at night; no way of
            knowing what might be in store from one moment to the next, knowing
            only that he had left the maternal security of his childhood
            home forever.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            As I stood there gazing abstractedly on the ring I wondered how
            long it would last. Relentless progress was pushing the edge
            of the city westward. There were new suburbs just beyond the
            hills that formed the eastern rim of the valley. Many of the
            old farms and much of the remaining bush had been turned into
            country estates, some of which were already being subdivided.
            How long would it be before this once-sacred site would be sold
            off for some hobby farm and the ring's embankment levelled, leaving
            nothing to remind anyone of what had been, the bora ground become
            just one more bit of the ancient palimpsest, lying<I> </I>dormant
            beneath the body of the earth with nothing at all, apart from
            maybe a brief mention in some ancient document hidden away in
            some obscure library reference section, to remind anyone of what
            had been? The dirt road that led past the ring would be sealed
            so that the shining four wheel drives of landowners wouldn't
            get dusty. Ride-on mowers would trim imported lawn where the
            ring had been. Horse stables or machinery sheds would cover the
            ancient pathway. And the people would not understand that what
            they built had no real or lasting economic foundation, that their
            dream acreage would eventually succumb to a returning bush that
            would, in some undreamed of variation of what had been there
            in the first place, reclaim the land.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            Darkness fell. I spread my ground sheet and lay down beside the
            ring (I was yet prepared to enter). I was tired and looked forward
            to sleep. But sleep didn't come. The ground was hard and damp,
            the night cooler than I'd expected. I lay there listening to
            the sounds of the night: owl hoots, grunts and hisses of possums,
            sighs and snaps of dry branches and other unidentifiable noisesAnd
            all the time I had the uneasy feeling of being watched. That
            was the worst bit; the sensation that I was trespassing and that
            someone was watching and judging.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            When I did finally fall into that wonderful pre-dawn oblivion
            of deep sleep the birds began. It was the kookaburras first,
            followed by crows, magpies, butcherbirds, parrots, whistlers,
            whipbirds and a dozen other species that, at some other time,
            I might have taken an interest in. And beyond all that call and
            chatter, like some hardly perceptible but insistent bit bass
            player in some madly out of tune and misdirected orchestra, from
            out of the thickets along the creek, came the deep booming grunts
            of the Pheasant Coucals.<BR>
            I rose from the hard ground, breakfasted from my meagre supplies
            of dried fruit, biscuits and condensed milk, repacked, put my
            backpack down and, steeling my resolve, walked into the middle
            of the ring. As I did the same feeling of being watched that
            I'd felt during the night returned. I turned to the old gum just
            beyond the circle's northern rim.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            'Who are you?' I asked the tree.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            'I am the guardian of the ring,' the tree replied.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            'So it was you watching over me during the night?'</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            A waft of early breeze stirred the leaves, a soft rustling sound.
            The sun rose from behind the eastern rim of hills. The first
            shadows of morning spread across the ground and over the ring's
            encircling wall. I stood in the centre of the ring facing the
            guardian tree.<BR>
            'Well, mister tree, are you angry with me?'</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            The tree stood still. There was something about that tree. I
            had the uncomfortable feeling that it was assessing me, trying
            to work out my real intentions. I stood there looking up at the
            tree in what I hoped was a suitably reverential attitude, waiting
            for a signal, something to indicate that what I was doing was
            all right.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            <I>Teewhee, tewaaaaa .....tewhew.......</I>The a loud falsetto
            cry issued from the tree. The call hovered in the air awhile
            then declined to silence.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            There's something special about Currawongs. You never see them
            in the city, only in the hills. They are birds of the high country,
            representatives of the pure and unpolluted world. If ever they
            succumbed to our relentless progress, as so many species have,
            that would really signal the end.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            I called up at the tree in a pathetic imitation of the bird's
            call and waited. After what seemed ages an answering call came
            clear and pure through the morning air, a wolf-whistle-like <I>Tewhew</I>
            And the bird, clumsy at first, flew out and away, calling out
            of the sky as it went. I watched the bird grow smaller and smaller
            against the blue until it was gone. I felt terribly alone.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            I collected my backpack and went through the narrow gap in the
            wall onto the path. At first the way was clear and easy to follow,
            the tall trees that lined the path giving an impression of a
            cathedral aisle down which one might walk as to some sacred alter.
            The sun, now above the eastern hills, cast slanting beams through
            the trees, spotlighting clumps of grass, fallen twigs, small
            flowers. Dark shadows fell across the path, creating cool lees
            where dew persisted. In the open places the rising sun drew moisture
            from the previous night's fall of humid air. Cicadas buzzed and
            birds called from the forest. A breeze whispered through the
            treetops, a soft voice.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Once</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">,
            the voice whispered, <I>there was a vast and godless land without
            ceremony or ritual, without the necessary markers by which people
            could make sense of it, a world without definition, with nothing
            to define or give boundaries to the people's lives. Tired of
            this chaos and formless existence I called the people together
            and told them that things must change, that they must define
            the various stages of life, that they must establishing their
            rituals and ceremonies in accordance with the nature of their
            world. I found this place and had the people build these rings.
            They scraped them out of the earth with what simple tools they
            could make and we laid down a path between them and placed along
            that path images of animals and birds and other things that sustained
            them. And into that place I had them bring the young ones whose
            minds were open to the unexpected and who had the capacity to
            imagine. From the ring they were led them along the path to see
            all of the things that had been put there and they were amazed.
            And there were among the things which they saw all the acts of
            the wise men and all the tricks of those well instructed in the
            arts of mime and magic and, towards the end, at the sacred ring,
            they were confronted by the simple but fearful gestures of the
            priests. Oh, the trials were long. They were pushed to their
            limits, those boys, until they shed tears of pain and frustration,
            until they were so tired and miserable that they could take in
            nothing from the external world. They did not stop there, but
            went on and on, not for a little way and not for just a day,
            but for many days, so that they might know that what they had
            left behind must be left behind.</I></FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial">The voice died. I walked on
            along the path, aware of the heavy crunching of my boots on the
            soft earth. After a while the steady tread of my boots became
            hypnotic, became the centre of my attention. They were like separate
            things and not part of me at all. High above, the muted murmur
            of morning breeze carried bird song through the leaves. Walking
            along that path seemed a special privilege. I wondered about
            the people who'd made it, how they must have done it in accordance
            with certain laws, without the aid of steel picks or shovels
            or theodolites or stringlines or laser beams. Using only the
            tools they could put together from local rock and flint and wax
            and fibre they had dug and scratched and pushed at the earth
            until, with endurance we would find difficult, if not unnecessary,
            they had made this sacred place. After so much effort it seemed
            unfair that the place would never again feel the patter of young
            and eager feet.</FONT></P>

            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            A few hundred paces from the large ring the tree cover gave way
            to open country, affording glimpses of the surrounding hills.
            Apart from the road and the rusting barbed wire fence that ran
            along side it there was no sign of human habitation. I was about
            to continue on when I noticed an indentation etched faintly into
            the ground. I looked more closely. They were cart tracks! They
            came from the direction of the road, crossed the bora path and
            continuing down towards the creek.</FONT></P>

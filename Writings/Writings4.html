            <P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">We were war babies, him and me, cosy
            in our wombs while millions were dying across Europe. Millions
            more would die in Nazi concentration camps before we were born.
            After centuries of inter-border disputes and wars big and small,
            just twenty years after the so-called 'Great War' and less than
            ten years after the 'Great Depression' Europe was at it again.
            Not that we cared, greedy little buggers snug in our mother's
            wombs, oblivious to a world that was changing beyond recognition.
            Protected from all that was going on in the outside world we
            grew fast, kicking around in our bubble, just a skin's thickness
            away from trouble.<BR>
<BR>
            I've often tried to imagine what it was like for our parents
            in the days before we were born. The places they found themselves
            in - his parents in a provincial city on the freezing shores
            of Lake Superior, mine in a provincial city at the edge of a
            more pacific ocean - were hemispheres apart yet they had in common
            at least this: that they were populated by the offspring of people
            who'd fled old Europe and its conflicts and inequalities; <I>refugees
            on the unarmed road of flight</I> bringing with them cultural
            prejudices and moral superiorities that they would continue to
            inflict on an indigenous population long subdued. Leaving our
            parents with racial attitudes that would, in the not too distant
            future, be severely challenged.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Those were the days of iron and steel.
            Duluth with its steel mills fed from iron ore dug out of the
            Iron Range up around Hibbing and its ship-building and its great
            port from which surplus iron ore would be sent down the Great
            Lakes seaway to the far corners of the world (some of it ending
            up in Lend Lease ordnance). Newcastle with its steel mills fed
            by iron ore shipped in from South Australia and fired by coal
            dug from mines up along the Hunter River valley. They were busy
            places in the days when we were being born.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With a name like Doolan my father's ancestors
            probably came to Australia from poverty stricken Irish village,
            probably shackled as convicts. That might explain why my mother,
            from more genteel English ancestry (so she would have us believe)
            insisted that my father change his name and religion before she
            would marry him. Na him? With a name like Zimmermann there had
            to be German connections</FONT>

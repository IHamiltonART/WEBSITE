            <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mianjin Crossing tells the story of two
            men born at different times in the development of Brisbane from
            convict days to the current time. The first, Jabiru, is born
            in 1820. After witnessing the death of a convict on the beach
            at Myora he travels to his initiation on the mainland. From there
            he journeys far and wide through a changing landscape, in the
            process witnessing the destruction of his people's culture. Jabiru's
            story is told over a period of six months to the dying lover
            of the second character, Will Traverse who was born during the
            Second World War and, as a young man, witnesses the arrest of
            a black man. As he tells the story of Jabiru to his lover Will
            reflects on his own life and the changing culture of his city.</FONT></P>

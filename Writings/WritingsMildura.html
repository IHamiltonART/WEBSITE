           FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I sometimes teach biology and understand
          that for the vast majority of organisms sexual rather than asexual
          reproduction is the only option. Biologists have theories, but
          no consensus about how sexual reproduction arose and what its
          survival benefits, in a Darwinian sense, are. They do understand
          - and agree - that sexual reproduction has led to elaborate and
          seemingly wasteful and dangerous sexual displays such as the
          tail of the peacock, the antlers of a stag and the bower-building
          and dancing of the Family <B><I>Paradisaeidae</I></B> (Birds
          of Paradise and Bower Birds). Some biologists use Darwinian theory
          to explain that sex is the reason for poetry, music and art in
          general.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian has approached some of these ideas
          from a different, non science direction. When he first spoke
          to me about his ideas back in 1978 I didn't understand what he
          was talking about. His key idea - one that he has repeated to
          me many times in the succeeding 30 or so years - was<BR>
                             <B><I>&quot;Time allows the elaboration of
          basic urges and/or forms&quot;.</I></B></FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now I see that some of what he was saying
          was not altogether unrelated to the more mechanistic theories
          of traditional science.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian began his work on bowerbirds when he
          was an Artist in Residence, at Griffiths University in 1976.
          He went to O'Reilly's, outside Brisbane, where he filmed and
          videotaped Satin Bowerbirds (<B><I>Ptilonorynchus violaceus</I></B>)
          working on their bowers. Looking at a videotape record of a male
          bowerbird placing twigs, stepping back and considering his work,
          before darting in to change the position of a stick. Ian was
          struck by how similar that action was to the way artists step
          back and view work in progress. He developed the idea that the
          bowerbird was not unlike the archetypically male artist using
          'free time' to create non-essential objects. He considered the
          notion that some species may, at certain times in history, have
          the luxury of free time (freedom from predation, territorial
          disputation and hunger) to indulge in non-essential behaviour.
          </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian became so interested that he did some
          reading and found out that the Golden Bower Bird (<B><I>Prionodura
          newtoniana</I></B>), which lives in the mountains of northern
          Queensland, built elaborate structures that were more like towers
          than bowers. He obtained a South Australian government grant
          to 'study the art of the Golden Bowerbird'. In Paluma, north-west
          of Townsville, he made contact with an academic ornithologist
          who showed him a bower/tower of the Golden Bower Bird (<B><I>P.
          newtoniana</I></B>). Ian set to work, in a manner that seemed
          to me very close to scientific, observing the natural history
          of <B><I>P. newtoniana</I></B>, finding 13 bowers/towers and
          observing them and their owner/builders over a period of several
          months.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I spent a few days beside Ian observing
          his work in the rainforest and have read his notes and looked
          at sketches, drawings, photographs and super 8 films he made
          at the time. His methods - both fieldwork and notations - seem,
          at first sight, indistinguishable from the fieldwork and records
          of a scientist. This is particularly evident in the enlarged
          reworked facsimiles of pages from his notebooks.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But Ian works with the eye and mind of
          an artist. He did not view the bowerbird as simply part of the
          natural world to be possessed, studied, catalogued and teased
          apart as it might be by a dispassionate scientist. He sees the
          bowerbird more like an artist. He sees the bowerbird's work as
          worthy of admiration for itself, no matter what the Darwinian
          may have to say about it. At first I did not understand one of
          his sketches that was later published in his 1983 publication,
          &quot;<B><I>Ceremony of the Golden Bower Bird&quot; </I></B>.
          The sketch showed a bird net stretched in the forest with a human
          figure trapped in it. The human figure is the artist (not the
          scientist that I originally took it to be) trapped, snared, made
          ineffectual by the scientist. Thus he drew a clear line between
          his work and sensibilities and that of the dispassionate professional
          ornithologist, who, in the legitimate pursuit of scientific studies,
          can net, tag, release or kill and preserve specimens.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a science teacher I sometimes find it
          difficult to understand Ian's thought processes. Like any artist
          he is sometimes unable to explain and understand all that he
          does himself. While his recent work lacks the high-energy performance
          art of the late 1970s, early 1980s (involving fluorescent and
          other lights in exploring ideas of the connections and interactions
          between nature and technology) there are at least three levels
          to his current output. At what I call the primary and least complex,
          but to me possibly most appealing, are the direct re-workings
          of his original notes and sketches. These are designed to sit
          on the wall like the open pages of a journal and convey the immediacy
          of fieldwork. At another level are works that respond to experiences
          and thoughts generated by earlier experiences. Here you will
          find new workings and interpretations, from various perspectives,
          of the forms and feelings of the bowers, still recognisably related
          to the raw materials. I think his wonderfully prepared and beautiful
          stylised bowers made from dry sticks span these two categories.
          And then there are works arising from places, feelings and impulses
          that even Ian doesn't understand, where pure artistic responses,
          welling up from the sum of nearly 40 years of involvement, thinking,
          feeling and processing in this one part of his work and artistic
          endeavour. These works lead into areas that can exasperate us
          too-rational science types and so may be the most profound and
          important.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian Hamilton's investigation of the enigmatic
          bowerbird takes the audience on a journey of physical and spiritual
          dimensions. The exhibition <I>Out of the Forest</I> is a deliberation
          on a bird, species, time, structure and perhaps an expression
          of self. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Mildura Arts Centre's main ground floor
          Gallery reveals a research project sustained over a 30 year period
          that evokes the spirit of the artist 'becoming bird'. This exhibition
          is unlike the other notable artist Kevin Mortensen, whose work
          has also had a long association with the bird/man nexus especially
          in his <I>Seagull Salesman</I> 1970s performance piece. Where
          Mortensen explored physical and allegorical references to the
          bird and human, Hamilton probes the poetic and aesthetic possibilities
          implicit in a spatial comprehension of being. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian Hamilton seems to have maintained this
          research project despite his fifteen year distraction working
          in arts administration; he has now become 'in tune' with this
          bird of immense creativity and aesthetic judgement. In reviewing
          his work we are drawn into the Deleuzian process of movement
          through orders of being such as: interest, sympathy, knowledge,
          empathy and becoming. Hamilton's fastidious documentation moves
          beyond the ornithological into the realm of the poetic, especially
          with the large format digital prints that document his sculptural
          works. Even the 'open book' styled pages of many of the 2 dimensional
          works set up a discussion that reveals empathy and comprehension.
          Notation moves beyond an interrogation of facts and into the
          lyrical. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hamilton's journey inverts the audience
          into a state of heightened awareness - we leave the gallery or
          'Bower' as someone who has perceptually 'been there'. The inscriptions
          and notations of the paths through the bower serve to orientate
          the audience. The precision alignment of sticks and twigs echoes
          the bird and the artist's fastidious judgement and acts as a
          binding element throughout the entire show. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The concave radial patterns, contrived
          from the physical bowers denote the inner space of the bower,
          which has become a repetitive motif throughout the exhibition.
          The form always has some energy path or structural inception,
          usually a branch or tree trunk that supports the initial orientation
          of the bower. These womb-like motifs could simply have fallen
          into the trap of pictorial clich&eacute;, yet Hamilton is beyond
          this. There is something of the primordial in this show: the
          hunter gatherers, the child's cubby house or the Abb&eacute;
          Marc-Antoine Laugier, rustic hut; we are forever cognisant of
          entropy, the natural world - its order and disorder.  </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With the potential extinction of the Spotted
          Bowerbird it would have been easy to make pretty works, tapping
          into the ingredients of pattern, plume, colour and allure, about
          an endangered species, yet Hamilton resists. These works are
          more than environmental rhetoric from superficial knowledge and
          glib advertising. The works become a metaphor for a much bigger
          discussion; they are in effect Ian Hamilton's own <I>Palimpsest</I>!
          </FONT></P>

          <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Out of the Forest</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">,
          despite its lyrical qualities is hand-inscribed with struggle.
          Hamilton still seeks discovery through this research process.
          Inevitably the artist/researcher must move beyond the comfort
          zone into new territory. Perhaps the bowerbird's plight is not
          unlike that of the artist. Initially both seek to create order
          and definition from random debris, yet both are at their most
          vulnerable whilst engaged in this creative act.</FONT></P>

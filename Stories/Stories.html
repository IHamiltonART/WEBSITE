      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hi, the above are images from Hungerford,
      where I went with my son on a<BR>
      father/son road trip. The bit below is an extract from a Henry
      Lawson short<BR>
      story about Hungerford (where he was sent by the Bulletin to
      sober up -<BR>
      walking the 220 k from Bourke)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">'One of the hungriest cleared roads in
      New South Wales runs to within a<BR>
      couple of miles of Hungerford, and stops there; then you strike
      through the<BR>
      scrub to the town. There is no distant prospect of Hungerford
      - you don't<BR>
      see the town till you are quite close to it, and then two or
      three<BR>
      white-washed galvanised-iron roofs start out of the mulga.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">'They say that a past Ministry commenced
      to clear the road from Bourke,<BR>
      under the impression that Hungerford was an important place,
      and went on,<BR>
      with the blindness peculiar to governments, till they got to
      within two<BR>
      miles of the town. Then they ran short of rum and rations, and
      sent a man on<BR>
      to get them, and make inquiries. The member never came back,
      and two more<BR>
      were sent to find him - or Hungerford. Three days later the two
      returned in<BR>
      an exhausted condition, and submitted a motion of want-of-confidence,
      which<BR>
      was lost. Then the whole House went on and was lost also. Strange
      to relate,<BR>
      that Government was never missed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">'However, we found Hungerford and camped
      there for a day. The town is right<BR>
      on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit-proof
      fence - with<BR>
      rabbits on both sides of it - runs across the main street...</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">'Hungerford consists of two houses and
      a humpy in New South Wales, and five<BR>
      houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs
      are in<BR>
      Queensland. We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence
      for it -<BR>
      we had asked for English ale.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">'The post office is in New South Wales,
      and the police-barracks in<BR>
      Bananaland. The police cannot do anything if there's a row going
      on across<BR>
      the street in New South Wales, except to send to Brisbane and
      have an<BR>
      extradition warrant applied for; and they don't do much if there's
      a row in<BR>
      Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border, where the
      pubs are.'</FONT></P>

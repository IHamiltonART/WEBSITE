      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Bowerbirds and the art of Ian Hamilton</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I sometimes teach biology and understand
      that for the vast majority of organisms sexual rather than asexual
      reproduction is the only option. Biologists have theories, but
      no consensus about how sexual reproduction arose and what its
      survival benefits, in a Darwinian sense, are. They do understand
      - and agree - that sexual reproduction has led to elaborate and
      seemingly wasteful and dangerous sexual displays such as the
      tail of the peacock, the antlers of a stag and the bower-building
      and dancing of the Family <B><I>Paradisaeidae</I></B> (Birds
      of Paradise and Bower Birds). Some biologists use Darwinian theory
      to explain that sex is the reason for poetry, music and art in
      general.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian has approached some of these ideas
      from a different, non science direction. When he first spoke
      to me about his ideas back in 1978 I didn't understand what he
      was talking about. His key idea - one that he has repeated to
      me many times in the succeeding 30 or so years - was<BR>
      <B><I>&quot;Time allows the elaboration of basic urges and/or
      forms&quot;.</I></B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now I see that some of what he was saying
      was not altogether unrelated to the more mechanistic theories
      of traditional science.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian began his work on bowerbirds when he
      was an Artist in Residence, at Griffiths University in 1976.
      He went to O'Reilly's, outside Brisbane, where he filmed and
      videotaped Satin Bowerbirds (<B><I>Ptilonorynchus violaceus</I></B>)
      working on their bowers. Looking at a videotape record of a male
      bowerbird placing twigs, stepping back and considering his work,
      before darting in to change the position of a stick. Ian was
      struck by how similar that action was to the way artists step
      back and view work in progress. He developed the idea that the
      bowerbird was not unlike the archetypically male artist using
      'free time' to create non-essential objects. He considered the
      notion that some species may, at certain times in history, have
      the luxury of free time (freedom from predation, territorial
      disputation and hunger) to indulge in non-essential behaviour.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Ian became so interested that he did some
      reading and found out that the Golden Bower Bird (<B><I>Prionodura
      newtoniana</I></B>), which lives in the mountains of northern
      Queensland, built elaborate structures that were more like towers
      than bowers. He obtained a South Australian government grant
      to 'study the art of the Golden Bowerbird'. In Paluma, north-west
      of Townsville, he made contact with an academic ornithologist
      who showed him a bower/tower of the Golden Bower Bird (<B><I>P.
      newtoniana</I></B>). Ian set to work, in a manner that seemed
      to me very close to scientific, observing the natural history
      of <B><I>P. newtoniana</I></B>, finding 13 bowers/towers and
      observing them and their owner/builders over a period of several
      months.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I spent a few days beside Ian observing
      his work in the rainforest and have read his notes and looked
      at sketches, drawings, photographs and super 8 films he made
      at the time. His methods - both fieldwork and notations - seem,
      at first sight, indistinguishable from the fieldwork and records
      of a scientist. This is particularly evident in the enlarged
      reworked facsimiles of pages from his notebooks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But Ian works with the eye and mind of
      an artist. He did not view the bowerbird as simply part of the
      natural world to be possessed, studied, catalogued and teased
      apart as it might be by a dispassionate scientist. He sees the
      bowerbird more like an artist. He sees the bowerbird's work as
      worthy of admiration for itself, no matter what the Darwinian
      may have to say about it. At first I did not understand one of
      his sketches that was later published in his 1983 publication,
      &quot;<B><I>Ceremony of the Golden Bower Bird&quot; </I></B>.
      The sketch showed a bird net stretched in the forest with a human
      figure trapped in it. The human figure is the artist (not the
      scientist that I originally took it to be) trapped, snared, made
      ineffectual by the scientist. Thus he drew a clear line between
      his work and sensibilities and that of the dispassionate professional
      ornithologist, who, in the legitimate pursuit of scientific studies,
      can net, tag, release or kill and preserve specimens.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a science teacher I sometimes find it
      difficult to understand Ian's thought processes. Like any artist
      he is sometimes unable to explain and understand all that he
      does himself. While his recent work lacks the high-energy performance
      art of the late 1970s, early 1980s (involving fluorescent and
      other lights in exploring ideas of the connections and interactions
      between nature and technology) there are at least three levels
      to his current output. At what I call the primary and least complex,
      but to me possibly most appealing, are the direct re-workings
      of his original notes and sketches. These are designed to sit
      on the wall like the open pages of a journal and convey the immediacy
      of fieldwork. At another level are works that respond to experiences
      and thoughts generated by earlier experiences. Here you will
      find new workings and interpretations, from various perspectives,
      of the forms and feelings of the bowers, still recognisably related
      to the raw materials. I think his wonderfully prepared and beautiful
      stylised bowers made from dry sticks span these two categories.
      And then there are works arising from places, feelings and impulses
      that even Ian doesn't understand, where pure artistic responses,
      welling up from the sum of nearly 40 years of involvement, thinking,
      feeling and processing in this one part of his work and artistic
      endeavour. These works lead into areas that can exasperate us
      too-rational science types and so may be the most profound and
      important.</FONT></P>

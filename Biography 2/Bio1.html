      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The first artwork I remember doing was
      a watercolour of a green field dotted with white flowers (daisies
      as in those little white flowers we made daisy chains out of).
      That was in prep 1 at Wooloowin State School and it was exhibited
      proudly in class. That painting, long disappeared, still evokes
      in me the sense of wonder I felt at the time. I can still see
      those little white flowers dotted across the green, can almost
      smell the grass! No artwork since has affected me as much.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      Through the early years I drew people and planes and boats and
      trains but the drawing my mother would often comment upon was
      of the family cat. Apparently that was special. Later in primary
      school I immersed myself in a subject called 'Geometric and Perspective
      Drawing', learning about vanishing points and other technical
      terms. One drawing I particularly recall was of a caravan done
      in the Geometric style, which meant angles of 45 degrees and
      weird perspectives. Like the flower-dotted field that drawing
      has long disappeared. One of the only remaining drawings from
      this time is of a fish leaping to catch a frog done on the inside
      cover of the 'Eagle Book of Trains', which I still have. I'm
      not sure about the fish or the frog but I retain an interest
      in railways.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      At Kedron High School I did a drawing of futuristic cars on a
      black background that was exhibited along with pretty landscapes.
      It was pretty good and everyone thought I'd end up working for
      General Motors as a designer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      As a teenager I studied art part time, including a brief period
      with a life drawing class led by the legendary Mervyn Moriarty
      (who later formed the Queensland Flying Art School). For my first
      lesson I took along a small sketchbook. and pencil and was embarrassed
      to find everyone drawing with blocks of charcoal on huge bits
      of paper. That was my first real lesson. I also studied briefly
      under Roy Churcher at the same campus where I was studying for
      my electrical apprenticeship and (part-time) electrical engineering
      (I would run into Roy sixteen years later when I went back to
      Brisbane as artist in residence at Griffith University and again
      in 1999 when Betty Churcher came to Mildura to do a TV program
      on the Mildura Art Centre's Degas pastel).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      When I was eighteen I went to Mt Isa to complete my apprenticeship
      and continue part-time Engineering studies. I found myself at
      one stage being taught art by a mad Balt who later topped himself
      (Mt Isa seemed full of mad people). He tried to teach a European
      version of landscape that I rejected. In Mt Isa there were few
      Autumnal leaves and even fewer snow-covered mountains. There
      were, however, opportunities to discover a landscape of despair.
      On one occasion I was returning a friend's old Bedford truck,
      from a dam site just beyond the Northern Territory border, and
      took a wrong turn. I ended up with very little fuel, at an abandoned
      outstation. When I switched off the engine and got out I felt
      an immense silence. I hadn't felt anything like that before.
      What I saw was a deserted shed and a dry dam ringed with dead
      cattle. That was frightening. Many years later I would visit
      another dry dam site north of Mildura that would become a favourite
      spot for drawing and which would inform my later drawings along
      the dry eastern escarpment of the Adelaide Hills.<BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the summer of 1961 I returned to Brisbane
      for a holiday, to find my father dying of cancer. I was with
      him when he died. I didn't go back to Mt Isa but finished my
      apprenticeship in Brisbane. I went wild after that. I joined
      the Alexandra Headlands Surf Lifesaving Club. For the next few
      years I would winter in Sydney and return to Brisbane each summer
      for the surfing season. In 1967 I spent time as an Electrical
      Engineer, on a Swedish merchantman, travelling the Pacific Rim.
      It was in San Francisco that I purchased my first Bob Dylan album.
      Dylan was for me a visual artist; his compositions as much movies,
      or enigmatic paintings, as songs.<BR>
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">When the ship returned to Brisbane I left
      and returned to my old workplace at the Evans Deakin shipyards
      at Kangaroo Point. It was there that I met Ted, a communist union
      official who would have a profound impact on me. He introduced
      me to the Foco Club, a left-wing organization that ran Sunday
      night events at the old Trades Hall. He also introduced me to
      John Dos Passos and his trilogy <I>USA</I>; a book that left
      a huge impression.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      In mid 1968 I met Jennifer Walker, a young teacher from Adelaide.
      Before a year was out I moved to Adelaide and we married in 1969.
      It was while studying art, part time at the South Australian
      School of Art, that my lecturer, Virginia Jay, convinced me to
      apply for full-time entry, which I did. <BR>
      I did well at art school but something happened at the end of
      third year that was to change my direction. During the Christmas
      break between third and fourth year I was working in a factory
      repairing fluorescent light fittings. One lunch hour I left one
      of the repaired fittings turned on in the corner of the workshop,
      turned the main lights out and left to buy some food. When I
      returned I couldn't help but notice the fitting glowing in the
      corner. I liked what I saw. It was at that moment I decided that,
      on returning to art school for fourth year, I would use the fluoro
      tube as a painting medium.<BR>
      This would lead to work that some saw as being influenced by
      Dan Flavin, but which in reality had much more to do with my
      own background (including the perspective drawings all those
      years ago) and with colourfield artists like Barnett Newman.
      Where Newman used paint strips to define spaces between colour
      fields I would use fluoros, arranging them on grounds such as
      fabricated boards and carpet underfelt. This led to a series
      of new works that would be displayed in the art school (<B>A</B>rt
      <B>S</B>chool??) gallery and outside the school.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">As a result of the exhibition I was offered
      a show at a well-known North Adelaide commercial gallery. However
      Art School policy forbade students showing at commercial galleries.
      Disappointed, I sought other venues. Late in the year I was given
      permission by the Australian Wool Commission to hold an exhibition
      in one of their old woolsheds at Port Adelaide. The exhibition
      'Light - Space - Colour' pitted fluoro installations against
      the light coming through cracks and openings in the building's
      cladding, doors and windows.<BR>
      The Adelaide Advertiser critic Ivor Francis wrote:<BR>
      <I>It is unethical and unwise for a critic to single out for
      special comment the work of a student attending art school.<BR>
      Ian Hamilton is an exception. He has received official approval
      for an exhibition and an investigation of public reaction to
      it as part of his final year diploma course at the SA School
      of Art.<BR>
      His medium is the fluorescent tube by means of which he explores
      space and colour and, by combining it with other objects, such
      as string and hessian, sees if they can all be made to fit together
      into a particular environment.<BR>
      This aim differs from Dan Flavin's systematic corner installations
      in the &quot;Some Recent American Art&quot; exhibition at the
      Art Gallery of SA.<BR>
      With a grand imaginative gesture of Michelangelonic proportions,
      Hamilton has used a vast, empty woolshed (No. 32) which is at
      Bedford Street, Gilman, and belongs to the Australian Wool Commission.<BR>
      It is a building pregnant with spine-chilling, surrealistic possibilities
      such as would have delighted the 18th century painter Giovanni
      Piranessi in his search for the macabre among the dungeons of
      ancient Rome.<BR>
      In this atmosphere of suspense and emptiness, among a forest
      of timber pillars streaking high up into the hovering gloom,
      Hamilton strung a vertical, blood-red fluorescent tube. As he
      looked back from the far-distant end of the shed, the tube peeped
      at him balefully, disappearing and reappearing eerily from behind
      one or other of the posts as he moved.<BR>
      Using this as a starting point, he strategically added other
      tubes of different colours which, together with string wound
      around the pillars and bits of dangling hessian has produced
      the uncanny effect of turning the perspective topsy-turvy.<BR>
      The result is a hard-to-describe but exciting total environmental
      kinetic experience for anyone able to enter into the spirit of
      it.<BR>
      However, if you view it only for the purpose of arguing whether
      it is art or not, you may just as well expect recompense for
      the bodily harm you may receive while precariously scrambling
      up tooth and nail into the woolshed to see it.</I></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Others must have taken note because, prior
      to graduating I was advised that I'd won an Australia Council
      'Living Artist' fellowship for 1975. This allowed me to continue
      work on light and space.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">My next exhibition was at the Experimental
      Art Foundation. Adelaide Advertiser art critic Nigel Murray-Harvey
      wrote of the exhibition:<BR>
      <I>Ian Hamilton's work with wool, fluoro tubes and skylights,
      at the Experimental Art Foundation is immensely refreshing.<BR>
      Two groups of fluoros, half hidden in greasy wool, seem at first
      to be pools of bright sunlight admitted by the two small skylights
      high in the bare corrugated asbestos roof of the partitioned-off
      corner of the former jam factory.<BR>
      It feels good to be there and the lack of motes floating in the
      shafts of light, which 'should' be there, makes much of the space
      between the skylights and their pools of light.<BR>
      Of the same exhibition Stephanie Britton wrote:<BR>
      With sheep sheering never too far away in Adelaide these days,
      art lovers are able to join the fun, though in a somewhat different
      fashion.<BR>
      Ian Hamilton, young local artist whose work with fluorescent
      light began while a student at the SA School of Art has produced
      an environmental piece at the Experimental Art Foundation, using
      wool and light.<BR>
      Basically it is about a simple optical illusion and although
      it works beautifully, to describe it in detail would remove the
      element of surprise for those who have not yet seen the show.<BR>
      One can say however, that he uses the roof structure of the Jam
      Factory with its skylights, some fluoro tubes and a large quantity
      of fleece.<BR>
      It is a work of great charm, sensuous with all that lanolin-smelling
      wool underfoot against the stark white walls and iron roof.<BR>
      Like a Magritte painting it relies on an innocent appearance
      and a sudden double-take, though Hamilton's revelation is a purely
      physical one to do mainly with a natural phenomenon albeit reinforced
      by art.<BR>
      The fact that the Jam Factory happens to have skylights nine
      metres off the floor is one of the unforseen bonuses of that
      eccentric building.<BR>
      Stephanie Britton also wrote, in the publication 'A Decade at
      the EAF':<BR>
      The conjunction of the new upstairs EAF gallery space and an
      artist with an interest in the modification of space with light
      led to perhaps the most successful use to which the gallery as
      a sculptural space was ever put.<BR>
      He filled the floor with piles of lanolin-smelling fleece and
      below the 9 metre high factory sawtooth roof skylight he embedded
      a 'daylight' fluoro. Since the tube (tubes) appeared to have
      the same dimension as the skylight the illusion was complete.
      The effect on a dull day of the bright patch of light on the
      floor was strangely powerful.</I></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1976 I was appointed Artist-in-residency
      at Griffith University in Brisbane for twelve months. Here I
      continued work on light, mounting installations at the university
      and at the Institute of Modern Art, in the city.<BR>
      Of one exhibition at the IMA, Sunday Mail critic Betty Churcher
      wrote:<BR>
      <I>At the Institute of Modern Art, two situation pieces provide
      a new experience for Brisbane. Both have been shown before in
      Adelaide, but I'm sure not more successfully than they are now
      in the simple white cubic space of the Institute.<BR>
      In the upstairs gallery, Ian Hamilton creates a more evocative
      and visual situation out of the double doors of the warehouse,
      some fluoro strip-lighting and a floor covered in raw wool. The
      access doors are just parted to allow a thin strip of sunlight
      which is simulated by the fluoro strip under the wool floor cover
      - a truly trompe-l'il effect which continues to confuse the observer
      long after the real sun has set.</I></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">However, my most interesting work was being
      done (un-reviewed) at the University. Taking the concepts used
      in the woolstores show in Adelaide a step further, I installed
      a series of fluoro light works in the forest surrounding the
      university campus. Most successful of these was the fluoro cube.
      Strung from high branches of the tall gum trees this fragile
      work would rise and fall up to three metres as the supporting
      trees moved in the wind. However, the university safety officials
      didn't take kindly to bare fluoro tubes strung on and around
      trees so the work was banned. The filmmaker David Perry (also
      artist in residence at the University) filmed the dismantling
      of the cube. Other art pieces included long strips of coloured
      fluoro tubes up the trunks of trees. At night these produced
      a spooky effect that drew the viewer deep into the forest. Other
      works produced at the university included experiments with perspective
      using string, laser beams and fluoro tubes. The best of these
      did indeed alter the viewer's spatial perception.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But I was ready to move on from fluoro
      work. While at Griffith University I'd developed an interest
      in ritual through the anthropological work of Victor Turner (who
      I had studied at art school) and a fascination with entropy and
      paranoia, partly through reading Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow.
      Perhaps looking for a way out of the fluoro tube work I presented
      a piece at the then Art Gallery of Queensland, to a group of
      mainly gallery 'friends'. Before a seated audience, and supported
      by slide and video projections portraying the action one second
      ahead of my real time performance, I placed a flouro tube on
      the floor, wired it and turned it on. All this was done very
      slowly. When the tube was lit I left the stage and returned with
      a rock. This I held over the tube for some seconds then dropped
      it. This caused a huge explosion, giving some in the audience
      a huge shock. Having done this I pointed to the floor where the
      rock sat among the debris of broken tube (both ends strangely
      intact) and left the stage.<BR>
      This performance signalled the end of my involvement with fluoro
      tubes as a primary art medium.<BR>
      During that same period I went to Lamington Plateau where I saw
      bowers of the Satin Bowerbird (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). I
      was taken by the complexity of the male bird's display and behaviour.
      I saw, in the construction and presentation of the bower, elements
      of both design and ritual, and a strong sense of colour. While
      filming one male bird building his bower I observed the bird
      stepping back from the bower, critically examining what it had
      just done, then racing back in to change it. This seemed a calculated
      action and not unlike the way artists work. I also observed so-called
      'playgrounds' of Tooth- billed Bowerbirds (Scenopoeetes dentirostris).
      While not as elaborate as the structures of Satin Bowerbirds
      these settings, made from overturned rainforest leaves, made
      for a kind of stage, upon which the male bird performed.<BR>
      Back in the University studio I assembled my own 'playground'.
      It consisted of a circular mound of leaf litter about two metres
      across and 20 cm deep, above which was suspended a yellow fluorescent
      tube (yes, the tube had reappeared). Around the walls I placed
      photocopy assemblages of images of various recent artworks and
      quotes from recent readings on art, entropy, paranoia and light.
      Two lasers directed beams across the stage so that when I sat
      on the stage (dressed in black and wearing a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
      bird's head) two pin points of red light appeared; one on my
      stomach and one on my back.  <BR>
      Because the lasers were hidden it appeared as if the beam was
      going through me.<BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Thus began an obsession that would continue
      for many years and that would re-emerge in later years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1977 I returned to Adelaide and began
      working as a senior project officer for a commonwealth employment
      scheme. In 1978 I received a grant from the South Australian
      Government to 'Study the Art of the Golden Bowerbird'. This allowed
      me to travel to the Mt Spec area northwest of Townsville where,
      over several weeks camped within the forest, accompanied by the
      sounds and creatures of the forest (including leeches), I observed
      the workings of the male Golden Bowerbird.(<I>Prionodura newtoniana</I>)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Intrigued by the complexity of Golden Bowerbird
      display (the male bird sang, mimicked, danced, built and decorated
      complex structures) I began to develop a theory about time and
      creativity I would later call; <B>Time Allows the Elaboration
      of Basic Urges and/or Forms</B>.<BR>
      The suggestion was that an organism free from the pressures of
      predation, hunger, parental duties and territorial disputation
      had time to elaborate on basic urges (nest-building) and forms
      (the form of the nest).<BR>
      In mid 1978 I was invited to participate in Act 1 in Canberra
      (an event organised by the Canberra School of Art). My piece,
      exhibited it in a Canberra park, drew on work I'd done at Griffith
      University and the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane during
      1976. It consisted of a circular 'stage' of leaf litter surrounded
      by rocks. Above this stage was a yellow fluoro tube hung vertically.
      Two lasers directed beams across the stage. Wearing black clothes
      and a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; bird's head I sat on the stage
      while my friend and fellow exhibitor Bob Ramsay circled the setting
      reciting a prepared text about time and creativity.<BR>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Later that same year the Institute of Modern
      Art accepted a proposal by Bob Ramsay and me to exhibit a performance
      piece titled The Brisbane Line; A Ritual Trance Walk. The exhibition
      documented a walk we had completed; a walk that led us from an
      Aboriginal bora ground (an initiation ritual site) in the foothills
      west of the city to a midden on Stradbroke Island. The route
      of the walk took us through the ruins of the Holy Name <BR>
      Cathedral in the city. In passing between two sites of pre-European
      culture we would enter the ruins of Brisbane's pre-global (Anglo-Irish)
      culture. Documented records of the walk, along with various objects
      collected along the way, were displayed in the Institute of <BR>
      Modern Art.<BR>
      I retraced that same route two more times; once with my friend
      Leo Davis in the Summer of 1979 and again (alone) in the summer
      of 1980. The experience would lead to the completion of two novels:
      <I>Meanjin Crossing</I> and <I>A Long Walk Through a Short History</I>.<BR>
      In 1983 the Experimental Art Foundation published <I>The Ceremony
      of the Golden Bowerbird: Playground for Paranoids</I>; essentially
      a script for performance based <BR>
      on my experiences in the rainforest and which brought together
      several trains of thought, including ruminations on creativity,
      science and art.<BR>

      the opening of the Prospect Art Gallery in 1988, the first purpose-built
      local government art <BR>
      gallery in metropolitan Adelaide. As Community Development manager
      I was the driving force behind its design and completion.<BR>
      In mid 1995 I left Prospect Council to undertake research for
      a book about country mayors. With an advance from publishers
      Wakefield Press, I set out on a journey around Australia, interviewing
      the mayors of country towns across Australia. <I>Heart of the
      Country</I> was published 1996.<BR>

      The 'Western Herald' from Burke stated:</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      <I>Bourke's Mayor Wal Mitchell is one of 17 rural leaders featured
      in  <BR>
      the book &quot;Heart of the Country&quot;, the result of author
      Ian Hamilton's  <BR>
      exploring what drives leaders of remote communities.<BR>
      Ian Hamilton is a city dweller and as he watched coastal cities
      grow  <BR>
      while inland towns declined, he wondered what went on west of
      the  <BR>
      Great Divide, what sustained this country and who was in control
      of  <BR>
      its destiny.<BR>
      So he set out to discover what sort of people took the task of
       <BR>
      guiding these areas, making decisions about their future.<BR>
      As a result, Ian spoke to Mayors, Shire Presidents, Shire  <BR>
      Chairpersons and Wardens, asking what drove them to keep their
      remote  <BR>
      corners of Australia alive.<BR>
      Ian put the stories of 17 rural leaders together, these being
      Wal  <BR>
      Mitchell of Bourke, greg Jones of Moree, Ross Miller of Toowoomba,
       <BR>
      Barry Braithwaite of Roma, Les Tyrell of Thuringowa, Ron McCullough
       <BR>
      of Mount Isa, Jim Forscutt of Katherine, Alan Eggleston of Port
       <BR>
      Hedland, Ron Yuryevich of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Malcolm Puckridge
      of  <BR>
      Ceduna, Eric Malliotis of Coober Pedy, Keith Wilson of Whyalla,
      Joy  <BR>
      Balluch of Port Augusta, Eric Sambell of the District of  <BR>
      Peterborough, Ruth Whittle of the town of Peterborough, Eddie
       <BR>
      Warhurst of Mildura and Murray Waller of the West Coast of Tasmania.<BR>
      After speaking to these people, Ian concluded that while they
      were  <BR>
      different, there was among them a common belief in the ability
      of the  <BR>
      individual or the small community to overcome adversity.<BR>
      These stories, including Wal's, can be read, enjoyed and learned
      from  <BR>
      Ian's book &quot;Heart of the Country&quot;.<BR>

      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">In March 1996 I was appointed Arts
      Manager to the City of Mildura. One of the first things I was
      asked on arrival in Mildura was, 'when are you going to reintroduce
      the triennials?' This was a reference to the highly successful
      Mildura Sculpture Triennials. I didn't think <BR>
      that was a good idea. The Mildura Sculpture Triennials were of
      a period, their place in art history was secure and inviolate.
      Instead I proposed a contemporary version, one that took into
      account recent thinking on matters such as ecology and the state
      of the Murray Darling river system and which allowed a wider
      spectrum of media. While mulling over what might replace the
      Triennials I happened to read a poem by Jennifer Hamilton titled
      View From a Plane. It read, in part:<BR>
      <I>The land lies beneath,<BR>
      a palimpsest etched<BR>
      erased and re-etched<BR>
      by wind and sun and time.<BR>
      Symbols in ancient script,<BR>
      knoll and ridge, rock and<BR>
      scrawl of creek bed speak<BR>
      of time and space beyond ours.<BR>
      Twisted and cramped, they<BR>
      are surrounded by<BR>
      lacunae, drifts of sand.<BR>
      A page of Tamil,<BR>
      mysterious dots, curls and spaces,<BR>
      signifiers, but..<BR>
      to us, unreadable.<BR>
      But it is our land.<BR>
      So owning it, we carve it.<BR>
      We slice the ancient<BR>
      parchment into squares,<BR>
      triangles, parallelograms,<BR>
      the straight line rampant.<BR>
      We push the scattered runes<BR>
      back into sand and time.<BR>
      Ploughing and planting<BR>
      turns the old faded brown<BR>
      Into sharper greens and yellows.<BR>
      And then the parchment<BR>
      Itself disappears<BR>
      Beneath the patterned crust<BR>
      Of the city.</I></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The word palimpsest stood out me. It seemed
      to summarise my own thoughts about landscape. Indeed, Mildura
      was a palimpsest, with its evidence of Aboriginal occupation,
      buried irrigation channels and dryland farms changed to irrigated
      vineyards. So, in 1998, began Mildura Palimpsest, a highly successful
      arts biennial that is still going strong, thanks to the support
      of many people. The fourth Palimpsest event in March 2000 coinciding
      with the second Regional Galleries Summit hosted by the Mildura
      Arts centre. Over one hundred artists from Australia and overseas
      participated in this event.<BR>
      http://www.mwaf.com.au/old_sites/palimpsest/index.html<BR>
      But perhaps the greatest highlight of the Mildura years for me
      was the <B>SunRISE 21 Artists in Industry Project</B>, which
      I initiated in 1998. With funding from several sources we were
      able to employ a curator (Helen Vivian) and five artists to work
      with five industry groups to produce five works of art reflecting
      the work of the host industry. This proved to be a In an odd
      way what I had seen at the site of the abandoned bower was similar
      to what I'd witnessed at the abandoned bora ring and the ruins
      of the Holy Name Cathedral <BR>
      all those years ago while undertaking the Brisbane Line project.
      My interest in making serious art was renewed.<BR>
      I left Mildura in late 200 and returned to Adelaide to begin
      a new phase in art making.<BR>
      Someone once said that 'artists can emerge at any time'. Back
      in Adelaide I felt that I was re-emerging as an artist. I began
      a series of forays to the escarpment of the Adelaide Hills with
      Ken Orchard, making pen and ink drawings of the landscape. Some
      of these I  <BR>
      converted to computer drawings using the Microsoft Word 'draw'
      facility. These 'computer drawings' were shown at the Station
      Masters Gallery at Strathalbyn in June 2002.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">But more and more I was drawn back to Bowerbird.
      I re-examined my work from the late 1970s and early 1980s and
      began constructing studio bowers from sticks found in and around
      my home in Adelaide. In 2005 I held a solo show at the Mildura
      Arts Centre titled <I>Out of the Forest: Bowerbirds and the Art
      of Ian Hamilton</I>. The exhibition included studio sculptures,
      large giclee prints, drawings, paintings and field journals.
      It was for me the most successful exhibition I'd mounted since
      the Woolstores exhibition of 1974.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In late 2008 I went back to the cloud forests
      of North Queensland with Leo Davis. We camped at the Paluma Dam.
      In the nearby forest, not far from an actual bower of the Golden
      Bowerbird, I built my own forest bower. 'No one will ever see
      it', Leo said. 'I don't care,' I replied. But I did continue
      to make works based on the bower bird for public display (entirely
      ephemera as it turned out). These included several installations
      at the Palmer Sculpture Biennial and the Heysen Sculpture Biennial.
      The last of these was a giant 'maquette' at The Cedars, part
      of the Bower Tower Project with John Hayward.</FONT></P>

      'memorials' to the bowerbird. One is near Euston in souther New
      South Wales, one near Hungerford in SW Queensland, and another
      at Mt Spec in far north Queensland.<BR>
